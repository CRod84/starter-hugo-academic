My research interest is the life cycle and ecology of dinoflagellates with meroplanktonic strategy. This refers to species that can be present in different forms, at different times, and in different environments. I focused the attention on the toxin producers and cysts-forming species. The aim is to predict harmful outbreaks and analyze their impact and implications for the conservation and management of the natural coastal resources (wild or farmed).
